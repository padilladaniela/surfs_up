## Overview of the analysis

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results

* *In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.95, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0. June is four degrees warmer than December.*

* *In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.04, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0*

* *Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December making a .5 difference in the two different seasons*

## Summary

The difference in the average temperature and the maximum temperature during the months of June and December are very close. Therefore, the changes during these motnhs should not impact the business in a negative way.  The precipitation difference between the months of June and December can be used to determine if one month has more rainy weather than the other. Two additional queries we can perform to get more data during the months of June and December are determining which month is the rainiest and determining the wind speed during these two months. This would help us further analyze the data and predict the effects during these two months.
